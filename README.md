  <h3>Power Outage Monitor</h3>
  <h4>with Telegram alerts</h4>
  <hr>
</div>

_This project was designed for my own personal productivity needs and by no means intended for wide distribution or production use as-is. Use or refactor for your own needs at your own discretion_

I created a CLI application to poll SCL power outage data and determine if a particular Seattle location is currently without power. Telegram alerts will be sent when power goes offline and when it returns.

Naturally, the outage monitor cannot run at the location being monitored.
